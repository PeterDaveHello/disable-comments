# Disable Comments for WordPress

## :construction: **This project is looking for maintainers!** :construction:

For various reasons I no longer have the time and inclination
to continue maintenance of this popular (>1,000,000 active installs) plugin. I am looking for people who would
be interested in continuing its maintenance. If you're interested and can demonstrate prior experience with
WordPress plugin maintenance please [get in touch](https://www.rayofsolaris.net/).
